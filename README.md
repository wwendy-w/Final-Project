**Description of Project**
<br><br>
For my project, I used the Food Inspection API from the Prince George's County Open Data website which is linked here: https://data.princegeorgescountymd.gov/Health/Food-Inspection/umjn-t2iz. The project inlcudes visualizations such as images and graphs. The images are PNG files and the graphs were generated from the ChartJS library. The CSS framework that I used was Bootstrap. The purpose of my project is to display the types of food inspections that are in-compliance and out-of-compliance to determine which inspections need to be reinforced. By determing the inspection that has the most out-of-compliance count, food establishments can focus on improving those aspects in order to ensure food safety and the well-being of the public.
