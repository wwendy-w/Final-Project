      The website provides information about Food Inspections and the data was
      collected from Prince Georgeâ€™s County Open Data. The page starts off with
      giving a description of what food inspections are and why they are
      important. The types of regulations are listed along with images to
      visually represent them. As the user scrolls down, there is a data visualization
      section which displays a drop-down menu and a bar graph. The drop-down
      menu lets the user filter through some of the different types of food
      inspections, although not all that was described in the dataset are shown. After the
      user have selected an inspection type, the bar graph will update to show
      how many of the selected inspection type was in-compliance and
      out-of-compliance. To check the exact number of counts, just hover over
      the bar. This visual display allows the viewer to observe and analyze
      which inspections are mostly followed through and which needs to be
      improved on.
